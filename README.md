# Change Request and Ticket Management System

Internship project at National Informatics Centre, Guwahati
## Abstract
The "Change Request and Ticket Management System" aims to replace the existing manual processes, which rely on email and messaging apps, with a digital solution that streamlines operations and improves overall efficiency. It offers a platform for Outsider Institutes to report issues, request changes, and track the progress of their submissions, while enabling the NIC to manage, prioritize, and implement these requests effectively.
